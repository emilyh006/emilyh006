Hello! I'm a master's student in **Computational Social Science** at UC San Diego!
- 🏙️ I have a background in **Pyschological and Brain Science** with a deep interest in **Social Cognition**.

## What is **Computational Social Science**?

**Computational Social Science** is a interdisciplinary branch of Data Science that integrates computational techniques with application in social science. Computational Social Scientists possess the skill set of Data Scientists while also having a strong foundation in social science theories and methods. Their expertise is highly transferable, allowing them to work in both industry and academic research, as well as in fields that bridge data science and social sciences.

## Interest

- 🔭 Currently I am working on a project introducing a novel methodology for **multiple imputations** across tabular and non-tabular data with effective and reliabile statistical estimation.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning in addition to Advanced Statistical Applications including predictive modeling, maximum likelihood estimation, Bayesian Methods.
  
- 📊 In the future, I am interested in diving into **methodological research**, focusing on enhancing experimental design, improving statistical modeling techniques, and developing robust computational methods for data analysis.

- **Languages**: R, Python, JavaScript
